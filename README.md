# Prodigy Infotech Project 2 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis and Trend Insights

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract meaningful insights and visualize trends. The goal is to understand passenger characteristics, survival patterns, and overall data structure using Python.

## Objective
- Perform data cleaning on real-world data (handle missing values, drop irrelevant features)
- Explore the dataset using descriptive statistics and value distributions
- Visualize key insights and trends using Matplotlib

## Dataset
- Titanic passenger data (`train.csv`)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Import**  
   - Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Dropped columns with too many missing values (`Cabin`, `Ticket`)
   - Filled missing values in `Age` and `Fare` with their median values

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed categorical distributions (e.g., `Sex`)
   - Explored survival rates and other passenger features

4. **Trend Visualization**  
   - Created plots to identify survival trends based on gender, age, and other features

## Learning Outcome
This project improved my understanding of real-world data preprocessing, how to deal with missing values, and how visualizations can reveal hidden patterns in structured datasets.

## Status
Project Completed
